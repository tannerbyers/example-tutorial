### To make a simple JavaScript quiz, there are four steps:

1. Set up the structure
2. Show the questions
3. On submit, show the results
4. Put it all together

The point of this tutorial is to make the simplest possible JavaScript quiz without any external code needed.

We'll also avoid animations, excessive styles, and anything else that will distract from the JavaScript quiz.

### A Quick Note Before You Start:
